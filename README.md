# Snake-Game-in-CLI
 
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game that runs in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Written in C, the game features basic snake movement, boundary collision detection, and a scoring system.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Real-time Snake Movement: Control the snake using 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for up, left, down, and right movements respectively.</li>
<li>Random Food Placement: The food (*) appears at random positions within the playing field, avoiding the boundaries.</li>
<li>Boundary Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary.</li>
<li>Score Tracking: Score increases by 10 points each time the snake eats the food.</li>
</ul>
