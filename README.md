# Snake-Game-in-CLI
 
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game that runs in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Written in C, the game features basic snake movement, boundary collision detection, and a scoring system.

Features:
<ul>
✅Real-time Snake Movement: Control the snake using 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for up, left, down, and right movements respectively.<br>
✅Random Food Placement: The food (*) appears at random positions within the playing field, avoiding the boundaries.<br>
✅Boundary Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary.<br>
✅Score Tracking: Score increases by 10 points each time the snake eats the food.<br>
</ul>
